    <p id=leftp>College has shaped his lifestyle to allow him to survive off of punk rock, caffeine, and little to no sleep, so he felt those skills could be well applied to gaming.<br>
    After 5 years of constantly hearing games recommended to him and never having the time to play them, he has decided to take this year off to start journeying through that catalog. Hopefully the journey and awkward moments of learning are entertaining enought for some of you to want to share that adventure with him. <br>
    This entire year Tucker will be streaming every day to complete his goal.</p>
